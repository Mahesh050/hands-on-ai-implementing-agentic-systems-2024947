## Course Description

Agentic AI shifts the focus of programming from responding to user input to actively pursuing defined goals. While the programming languages and frameworks may be familiar, the structure of the programs and the infrastructure they use are very different. In this course, software developer and project manager Keith Casey explains and demonstrates these changes, exploring the architectural shifts before moving into three concrete projects, each with challenges for learners.  The course concludes with a look at the future and the difficult problems—like privacy—that developers will need to figure out.
